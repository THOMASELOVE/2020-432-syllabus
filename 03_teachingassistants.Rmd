# Teaching Assistants

- To contact the TAs (and Dr. Love) at any time, email `431-help` at `case dot edu`.

The teaching assistants for 432 this year are 

- [Benjamin Booker, BS]
- [Julijana Conic, MD]
- [Joseph Hnath, BA]
- [Amr Mahran, MD MS]
- [Amin Saad, MD]
- [Jing Zhang, MD MS]

They are the people answering `431-help at case dot edu`, and they are the people holding the bulk of our regular office hours. Most of them has been in your shoes - they've taken the course in the past, and they enjoyed it enough to come back for more. Many have volunteered their precious time and energy to help make the course happen, and we couldn't be more delighted to welcome you to the course. To contact the TAs, email `431-help at case dot edu`, which is open all semester, starting on the first day we meet.

## Office Hours for TAs

- To contact the TAs (and Dr. Love) at any time, email `431-help` at `case dot edu`. This is a challenging class. Don't suffer in silence - talk to us!

Teaching Assistant Office Hours are held in either WG-56 (Computing Lab) or WG-67 (Student Lounge) on the ground floor of the Wood building in the School of Medicine, so be sure to look in both places if you need help. The weekly schedule will be posted on the bottom of the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md). 

TA office hours are not held on University holidays, or during Spring Break, although 431-help remains open until the last project is completed in May. 

This is a challenging class. Don't suffer in silence - talk to us!
