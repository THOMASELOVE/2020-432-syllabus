["course-description.html", "Section 1 Course Description 1.1 General Approach / Topics 1.2 Prerequisites 1.3 Everything is on the Web", " Section 1 Course Description PQHS 432 (cross-listed as CRSP 432 and MPHP 432, and formerly known as EPBI 432) is the second half of a two-semester sequence (with PQHS 431) focused on modern data analysis and advanced statistical modeling, with a practical bent (as little theory as possible), emphasizing the key role of thinking hard, and well, about design and analysis in research. The title listed by the registrar is a little dated - I prefer Data Science for Biological, Medical or Health Research. This is a good course for people who want to learn how to use the R language to get information from data, and who want to learn about making comparisons and building models to help make meaningful progress in research, focusing on questions from biology, medicine and public health. We spend time managing and visualizing data, building models and making predictions, and other things thought of as “data science” - in essence, this highly applied course focuses on modern, more than classical, tools for learning from data. The course is taught using the R statistical software and RStudio environments, with the material discussed in 431 assumed in 432. Students learned a lot of R in the 431 course, and that material remains available at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431. We’ll continue to use R Studio and R Markdown as tools to help make R work better, and perform our research in replicable ways. 1.1 General Approach / Topics The course covers the following general topics, roughly in this order, through early April. Additional topics (for the remainder of April) will be determined later in the semester. Linear Regression (including weighted and robust approaches, variable selection, dealing with missing data, fitting non-linear relationships through predictor transformation, cross-validation approaches, and multi-factor ANOVA and ANCOVA) Logistic Regression (including both models for binary outcomes, and models for proportions, and risk adjustment) Generalized Linear Models (including regression models for count data, multi-categorical outcomes) The Statistical Crisis in Science Cluster Analysis (mostly in the form of Principal Components Analysis) Survival Analysis (Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox Regression) 1.2 Prerequisites Taking 432 without 431 is not recommended. The pace can be brisk at times, but all CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, in any field of study. The main things students need for 432 are: tools: substantive knowledge of the use of R, R Studio and R Markdown to produce code which will ingest, visualize, explore, analyze and model data, then communicate the results statistical methodology: substantive understanding of statistical inference in the one-, two- and multi-sample cases and the fundamentals of linear regression models, including the building of multiple linear regressions, and their evaluation through diagnostic plots, stepwise model selection, assessment of uncertainty via confidence and prediction intervals, and basic in-sample and out-of sample validation summaries data to study related to biological, health, medical, scientific or other phenomena, and an interest in studying data closely and presenting rigorous analyses effectively Some of these topics are reviewed in early 432 sessions. 1.3 Everything is on the Web https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432 is the place to go for everything related to this course. Please visit any time you need something. I update the web site frequently. The most important thing is the Course Calendar which serves as the final word for all deadlines, plus links to all classes and deliverables. Dr. Love’s book of 432 Course Notes is the principal textbook for the course, and will appear during the semester. The Spring 2019 version is available now. Additional details will be coming soon.

Love, Ph.D. Professor of Medicine, Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, CWRU Director of Biostatistics and Evaluation, Center for Health Care Research &amp; Policy, MetroHealth Medical Center Chief Data Scientist, Better Health Partnership Track Lead for Health Care Analytics, MS in Biostatistics, Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, CWRU Fellow, American Statistical Association 2.1 A More Complete Biography Hi. I am Thomas E. Love, Ph.D. and I have at least three different jobs. I am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population &amp; Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses per year there (PQHS 431, 432 and 500) and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics. I direct Biostatistics and Evaluation at the Center for Health Care Research &amp; Policy, which is a joint venture of CWRU and MetroHealth Medical Center. For ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for Better Health Partnership, an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I now serve as Chief Data Scientist there. I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won numerous awards for my teaching and my research, including the 2018 John S. Diekhoff Award for Graduate Teaching from CWRU. I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every manner of CWRU student over the years, especially students in biostatistics, medicine, and management. In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records. You may be interested in a recent study in Health Affairs showing the impact of a Medicaid-like expansion plan on care and outcomes of poor patients in Cleveland. Or you might be interested in our New England Journal of Medicine study of the effect of electronic health records on the care and outcomes of people with diabetes. In 2011, James O’Malley and I chaired the Ninth International Conference on Health Policy Statistics, here in Cleveland. Here’s a recap. I’ve also worked on many projects involving the use of propensity scores to make causal inferences from observational studies, particularly in heart failure. If you want to see a pretty complete list of my publications, knock yourself out. I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation adviser was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman who is an attorney at GE Lighting, and we are raising two terrific sons. The elder is a junior in college (University of Pittsburgh) who plans to be a paleontologist, and one finishing high school this year, who will attend Columbia this Fall. I live in Shaker Heights. I also sing and act occasionally in community theater. 2.2 Email Email to get help with the course: 431-help at case dot edu (seen by Professor Love and the TAs) Thomas dot Love at case dot edu (for matters related to grades or individual concerns) Professor Love is hard to reach by phone. Email is always the best way to reach him. 2.3 Offices Wood WG-82J on the ground floor of the Wood building (Tuesdays and Thursdays) Rammelkamp R-229A at MetroHealth Medical Center (Wednesdays and Fridays) Professor Love is available for the 15 minutes before and the 30 minutes after each class, and otherwise by appointment on Tuesdays and Thursdays (send email to schedule). 2.4 Name and Pronouns Professor Love uses he/him/his pronouns. Most students refer to him either as Professor Love or Dr. Love. He prefers his given name to be written “Thomas” as opposed to “Tom”. Most of his friends and colleagues call him “Tom”. You are welcome to do so, as well, if that makes you more comfortable. 2.5 Web Professor Love’s GitHub pages website. His GitHub name is THOMASELOVE. His Twitter handle is ThomasELove. "],

["a-few-writingpresenting-tips.html", "Section 5 A Few Writing/Presenting Tips", " Section 5 A Few Writing/Presenting Tips Statistics is a “getting the details right” business - we care deeply about details, and this applies to writing code or complete English sentences. Nothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables. Don’t parrot back material that Dr. Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in other words is, technically, plagiarism. Edit your more adventurous output; don’t present everything you know how to do in R, and don’t forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results. Make your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary. Clearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate. Simplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well. Data are plural. Use “the data are …” rather than ``the data is … ’’ A paragraph must contain more than one sentence. Don’t switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout. Don’t write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result. Similarly, don’t defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in. If you want to write that you used \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) as your significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval. If you’re looking at a p-value, then you should state either: [1] We’re using a 95% confidence level. [2] We’re using a 5% significance level. or [3] We’re using \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). Don’t use more than one of these expressions. Refer to all p-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), rather than, for instance, \\(p = 0.00000001\\) or, worse yet, \\(p = 0\\). In a similar vein, write all \\(p\\)-values that exceed 0.99 as \\(p &gt; 0.99\\) instead of, for instance, \\(p = 1\\). To the extent possible, don’t use computer-ese to label variables, plots or tables. R and Markdown allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things – do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage. Use words that we all know, whenever possible, and provide clear definitions at the first encounter when jargon is mandatory. Often the most useful thing you can do in an analysis is to turn a table into a meaningful graph. When in doubt, err on the side of clearer expression. Clear thinking causes and is demonstrated by clear writing. In the words of Edward Tufte, to think clearly, keep asking yourself … "]
